# Englang
I conceived of this project after considering the fact that programming languages, in general, have very few reserved words. Therefore, the syntax itself tends to be relatively easy to pick up. However, the same cannot be said for most spoken languages. I took this as a challenge to introduce a new way of outputting English text: by coding it.

Englang will likely not take experienced programmers a particularly long time to understand. The grammatical quirks of English are handled by the compiler, and the reserved words (which generally correspond to functions) are few. The one caveat, of course, is nouns. In the same way that a programming language will not have a fixed set of variable names from which you can choose, we can't easily represent nouns in text without writing the nouns themselves. However, perhaps an emoji add-on is forthcoming. 

With the immense power that LLM's have today, it has become commonplace to see natural language translated into code. Instead of writing a bunch of boilerplate, you can say a few things to a model and have it spit out a basic Express server. Or you can ask for a quick and dirty Python script to batch process some videos with FFMpeg, and boom, there it is. So why not see if we can go the other way?
